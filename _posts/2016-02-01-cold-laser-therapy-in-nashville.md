### **DEEP TISSUE LASER THERAPY - AKA COLD LASER THERAPY**

Pain is one of the biggest reasons most patients go to the doctor.  When Dr. Michael and Dr. Callie founded Art of Health Chiropractic they wanted to have the most advanced pain relieving treatments available for their patients.

Advanced Deep Tissue Laser Therapy is cleared by the FDA and provides**safe, non-invasive treatments for a large variety of ailments**. Most patients see results within 3 to 5 short treatments. The Deep Tissue Laser Therapy works by flooding the tissue with photons, which energize cells resulting in increased circulation to the injured area and ultimately reduces pain.  

Laser therapy allows your body to utilize its own healing capabilities by inducing a series of healing responses in your body. During treatment you will feel a soothing warmth that initiates your body's healing process leading to decreased pain and inflammation.

Many sports teams and athletes utilize the LiteCure Medical lasers for treatment every day - the University of Florida, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Celtics and the Chicago White Sox. However, Deep Tissue Laser Therapy isn't just for our athletes.

Laser treatment is proving to be successful in healing the symptoms associated with chronic arthritis, post-surgical healing, frozen shoulder, plantar fasciitis, and many other complicated cases. Check out a few of the latest reviews by some of our patients.
